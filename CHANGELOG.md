## 1.0.0 - January 10, 2019  (current)
*This is being compared to the last update (3.1) on Part to Terrain Classic.*
* Now the plugin uses ModuleScripts rather than one whole script to do everything. 
* Completely redesigned UI to use Studio widgets rather than ScreenGuis.
* UI has a Light and Dark mode based off of Studio's current selected theme.
* Added a "Check for updates" setting.
  
  - If checked, it will show a note on the top of the UI alerting you of an update if the plugin is not update to date.

  - If unchecked, it will show nothing when out of date.
* All settings will now be saved and will use the same value when relaunching Studio.
* Selection Box will now glow green or red depending if it is able to be converted the part selected or not.
